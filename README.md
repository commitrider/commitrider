## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer with a passion for building fast, accessible, and scalable web applications. I specialize in crafting modular and maintainable UIs using modern frameworks like React and Next.js, with a strong emphasis on performance, responsive design, and seamless user experience.

I bring deep knowledge of frontend architecture, design systems, and tooling — working closely with designers, backend teams, and product stakeholders to deliver high-impact applications across platforms.
